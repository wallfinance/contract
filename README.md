The Wall Finance is the most innovative and secure digital asset on the market. Our unique feature, "The Wall," is a proprietary algorithm that helps maintain a higher pressure of buyers compared to sellers. This is achieved through tax adjustments that discourage sales and encourage purchases.  
Our token taxes are 4% for both buying and selling, but "the wall" comes into play if there is a large price drop. The wall increases the selling tax of the token, disincentivizing the immediate sale and encouraging slow, steady growth. Invest in The Wall Finance and take advantage of the protection and stability of the wall.

To calculate the levels of the wall, the price is considered, which is calculated based on the ETH in liquidity relative to the two previous transactions. If the transaction causes an increase of 2% of ETH in liquidity compared to the two previous transactions, then the wall will be equal to the value of ETH of the two previous transactions. When the wall is not active, the token tax is 5% on sales and purchases. This tax will be allocated according to the scheme published on Github to investments, marketing, and dev remuneration. If a user decides to sell despite the wall, the tax will be increased to a maximum of 28%, and 10% will be allocated to a diversified investment portfolio that will generate a profit that will be returned to holders through the staking of wall tokens.

The wall has a fixed total supply of 10,000,000 tokens, with 8,000,000 (80%) tokens allocated for public sale and 2,000,000 (20%) tokens allocated for staking, a pool, marketing, and advisors.
When the "wall" is not active, there is a 4% tax on all buys and sells of The wall, which is divided into 30% for marketing, 30% for the development team, and 40% for investments. When the "wall" is active, the tax increases to 28%, with the same exact distribution of funds. These taxes help to regulate the supply and demand of The wall, maintaining a stable value and protecting against market fluctuations.
Overall, the tokenomics of The wall aims to create a healthy and sustainable economic system that benefits all stakeholders in the ecosystem.
