We want to inform that all the contract uses this class to create a random value

 function rand() public view returns(uint256)    {
        uint256 seed = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(
        block.timestamp + block.difficulty +
        ((uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.coinbase)))) / (block.timestamp)) +
        block.gaslimit + 
        ((uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender)))) / (block.timestamp)) +
        block.number
        )));
        return (seed - ((seed / 10) * 10));
    }

This strategy was validated by many important project and we fell safe to use it in our.
